# Frontier Test for Junior Backend Engineer.

## The Test uses Typescript and Node js(Express js) as instructed.

## The Test uses Puppeteer for Robot Automation as instructed.

## The Test Involves a unit test using Jest Testing Framework as also requested.

## You can clone the project and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies for the project.

## These tools were so new to me and i had bever used any till now but i loved the adventure and sat down and painstakingly learnt as much as i could.

## It was also structured and written with readability and scalabilty in mind.

## I enjoyed the experience and hope The Frontier Engineering team can get back to me with my mistakes and also corrections to be made,no matter the outcome.

### The almost late submission is due to me getting notified of the mail 2 day after it was sent.

## I would also keep refactoring this repository as i learn more .
